# [Sco.js v1.0.2](http://terebentina.github.io/sco.js)

A collection of jQuery plugins for the web. Inspired by Twitter Bootstrap js components, Sco.js plugins can be used as replacement for the bootstrap js. You can find a different approach for some of the bootstrap js as well as
other plugins that don't exist in bootstrap. Sco.js uses much less HTML markup than bootstrap and provides sane and intuitive defaults for its options so that you can get started in no time.
It was created and is maintained by <a href="http://twitter.com/dancaragea">@dancaragea</a>.
